# AoC - 2020  

My objective this year is to prove everything can be done in a Python one-liner.  

Considerations:  
1. Max 2 lines by day (one by part), includes and empty lines are excluded.
2. When possible, read the file just once.
3. When possible, use generators instead of lists.
4. Make lines as short as possible.
5. When feasible, make a readable line. (unlikely)
