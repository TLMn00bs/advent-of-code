# AoC - 2020  

My objective this year is to prove everything can be done in a Python one-liner.  

Considerations:  
1. Max 1 line by part, step-by-step solution, includes, coments and empty lines are excluded.
2. When possible, read the file just once by part.
3. When possible, use generators instead of lists to avoid memory usage.
4. Make lines as short as possible.
5. When feasible, make a readable line. (unlikely)
