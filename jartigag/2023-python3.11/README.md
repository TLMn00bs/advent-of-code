my solutions to Advent of Code 2023.
this year i'm updating my python skills with enhancements like type hinting ([PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/), python version 3.5), the walrus operator ([PEP 572](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/), python version 3.8), [dataclasses with post-init](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/dataclasses.html#post-init-processing) processing, and [@property decorator](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/functions.html#property) for read-only attributes.
